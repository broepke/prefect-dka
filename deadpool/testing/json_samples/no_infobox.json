When Schabowski was asked when this loosening of regulations would take effect, he glanced through his notes, then said, \"sofort, unverz\u00fcglich \" (\"immediately, without delay\"), touching off a stampede of East Berliners to the Wall . Brokaw had an interview with Schabowski after the press conference, who repeated his \"immediately\" statement when pressed. Later that evening Brokaw reported from the west side of Brandenburg Gate on this announcement and the pandemonium that had broken out in East Berlin because of it.",

This is a declaration and an execution of an attack on the United States.\" He continued to anchor coverage to midnight on the following two days. Later that month, a letter containing anthrax was addressed to him as part of the 2001 anthrax attacks . Brokaw was not harmed, but two NBC News employees were infected. In 2008, he testified before the Commission on Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism about the anthrax attacks, publicly discussing his experiences for the first time in a detailed, day-by-day account.",

The magnitude of a news event could be measured by whether Brokaw and his counterparts on the other two networks showed up on the scene. Brokaw's retirement in December 2004, followed by Rather's ousting from the CBS Evening News in March 2005, and Jennings's death in August 2005, brought that era to a close.",
